# lily58 Weyland Yutani/Colonial Marines OLED
![picture](full.jpg)

Aliens themed OLED displays for Lily58 !!**R2G**!! based on the [R2G Via firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/lily58/keymaps/via_mechboards). Can be adapted to other QMK devices supporting oled displays (with a little work).

Please refer to the official [QMK documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/) for installing/modifying your firmware. I am not responsible for the things you do with your own hardware :)

## Modifying display
My left display is customised to show my charachter information. To update the image on either of the displays, you need to create/modify a 32x128 bitmap image and provide it to the [image2cpp](https://javl.github.io/image2cpp/) tool using the **vertical** draw mode.

## Build details
