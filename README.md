# lily58 Weyland Yutani/Colonial Marines OLED
Weyland-Yutani/Colonial Marines themed OLED displays for Lily58 **R2G**. Can work with other QMK devices with some work.

Please refer to the official [QMK documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/) for installing/modifying your firmware. I am not responsible for the things you do with your own hardware :)
